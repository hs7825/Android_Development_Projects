## Notes

The most tedious part of building the application was getting the UI right. I am still familiarizing myself with the constraints so if they were not set right they would move all over the place when I ran on the emulator. I also noticed I needed to search a lot for ways to manipulate the button component so trying to remember that is definitely useful. Also, I need to write out the logic I want my app to have before actually coding. I found myself going back too much trying to understand why I did not receive my desired outcome.
